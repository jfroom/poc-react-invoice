# poc-react-invoice [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jfroom/poc-react-invoice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jfroom/poc-react-invoice)

Simple React/Redux/Router/Flow based Invoice SPA proof-of-concept. Loosely based on [Seed Frontend Homework](https://github.com/seedco/frontend-homework).

Demo: https://jfroom.github.io/poc-react-invoice

[Blog post](https://medium.com/@jfroom/invoice-prototype-react-redux-router-flow-spa-8d0b3f70499c) with a bit of commentary on the technologies.

# Getting Started

## Required

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 17.03.0-ce+. This should also install Docker Compose 1.11.2+.
2. Verify versions: `docker -v; docker-compose -v;`

## First run
`docker-compose build` Builds images.

# Usage
## Development
`docker-compose up` Starts web server.

`open http://localhost:3000/` Loads default page into local browser.

`docker-compose exec web yarn lint` Run linter, stays open with watch.

`docker-compose exec web yarn flow` Run Flow type checker, stays open with watch. Flow much easier to work with inside of an IDE like Atom with Nuclide, or WebStorm.

## Test
`docker-compose exec web yarn test` Run test suite, stays open with watch.

## Build
`docker-compose exec web yarn build` Create production build of static files.

`docker-compose exec web yarn serve-build` Serve the build locally.
